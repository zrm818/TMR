Verilog Simulation of Triple Module Redundancy in Saturn V Launch Computer

This is the Verilog code that I have written for a final project in ECE526 (Verilog & SystemVerilog). The project studied 
Triple Module Redundancy and its specific implementation in the Saturn V Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC).

There is also a pptx and pdf of my final report materials for the class, which may be helpful to understand the project.
